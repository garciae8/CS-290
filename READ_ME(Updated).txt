For the first website, I like the Apple website because its interface is very easy to understand and their products are on the front page as big as possible, for me the reason why I like it the most is because it appeals to getting the attention of the audience to stay on the website longer than usual. I think the only improvement could be an easier way to locate customer service in my opinion like by having a phone number visible instead of being under support

The second website I think is really good is the Youtooz.com website since it puts its most relevant products at the front and has an easy interface for purchasing products. I also like how it's not hard to find other products that they have available and if any products are going on sale or won't be available after a certain date they have a countdown for both to let viewers know. I only think the improvement that can be made is when purchasing the item since it can be a little delayed and it takes you to another site when using some of the third-party paying options website instead of being in the browser.

For the third website I chose Amazon and I don't like it too much since it recommends products based on your interest but I wish there was a less personalized method of going through the online store and having different labels for their tabs. I know it's mainly supposed to be used for its search bar but I think it's kind of small and it mainly tries to push products you weren't interested in down your throat.

For the fourth website, I chose eBay which I prefer a little more than Amazon but has some of the same faults albeit better than Amazon since the sizes are way bigger. The one thing I would change about eBay is maybe making a more user-friendly method of teaching the user how to sell products on the website.

For my final website, I chose the Funko Pop official website which is not bad but it's not my favorite. My only real nitpick with the website is how it doesn't really show release dates for future figures and where to get them on the front page which I remember it used to do. I do like its interface since it is friendly to newcomers who may have come across the website naturally and loads quickly with some pop-up ads that I would just not have in my opinion
